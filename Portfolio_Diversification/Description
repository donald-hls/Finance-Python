This is a Python-based model that use Pandas, and Matplotlib to optimize portfolio diversification across 5 sectors, reducing
volatility compared to high-risk stocks. Analyzed risk-return tradeoffs using Sharpe ratios and visualized
performance trends within various sectors. 

I created a customized portfolio aligned with my own somewhat risk-averse preferences, named as Personal_Portfolio. 
I've always been trying to overcome my greediness in investing, Thus, I try to use my portfolio as a guide to help me 
navigate my investment Strategies. 

My Personal Portfolio includes: Nvidia, BND (Bond ETF), MS (Morgan Stanley), XLF (Finance Sector ETF), and QQQ (Tech ETF). 
Some of the data insights are included in the file attached to this directory. I use this as a guide for long-term investing over time.

Investing involves risks, including the potential loss of principal. :)
