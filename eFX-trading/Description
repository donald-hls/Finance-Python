The project allows you to investigate: 

  - Market Orders / Limit Orders
  - Trading FX with real-time bid-ask with tight spread
  - In the event of large volume orders, break into Algo orders to avoid slippage
  - Tracking PnL


Issues / Areas to Improve: 
  If you have any ideas to improve the code posted or would love to talk about it, happy to chat. 

1. Not being to access faster real time data, currently relying on 1.5 sec - 3 sec delay per YFinance Query. 
  - This issue is reflected in the screenshots attached in the directory. 
2. Could Potentially add more risk management strategies. 
  - How does auto hedge work? taking an opposite position of your trade? if yes, by how much? 
  - What's the risk tolerance?
